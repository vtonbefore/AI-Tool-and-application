# 🧠 AI Tools Assignment – Final Project

Welcome! This is my final project submission for the **AI Tools Assignment** as part of my Software Development course with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** at **Power Learn Project Academy**.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This assignment explores key areas of AI and Machine Learning, covering:

- 🔹 **Theoretical understanding** of popular AI tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, spaCy)
- 🔹 **Hands-on implementation** of classical ML, deep learning, and NLP
- 🔹 **Ethical reflection** on bias and fairness in AI
- 🔹 **Bonus:** Optional deployment using Streamlit or Flask
